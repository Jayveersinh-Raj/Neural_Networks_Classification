This notebook contains classification problems using Neural Networks in Tensorflow
Key highlights;
1. Types of classfications : i. Binary ii. Multiclass iii. Multilable
2. What happens if we try to approach such problem using Regression with visualisation
3. Creating model to solve different types of classification problems
